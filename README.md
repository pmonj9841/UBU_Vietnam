# The International Summer Camp – Urban Beyond the Urban

UBU is the annual International Summer Camp for “Travelling - Studying - Experiencing” together. 
The UBU 2024 is organized by the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City and 
collaborates with Handong Global University (South Korea), Thammasat University 
(Thailand), Universitas Ngurah Rai (Indonesia), the University of Trieste (Italy), and 
Catholic University of Leuven (Belgium). 

The theme is “Smart Approach: Co-Design Platform & Nature-Based Solutions for Cam Lam, Khanh Hoa”.
We thought about how to develop the area while protecting the nature.

The posters below are the results of our team

- The Cam Lam is subject to development for tourism. During our field research in Cam Lam, we observed that many local residents rely heavily on the natural environment, sustaining their livelihoods through agriculture and fishing in the lagoon.  
- We also noted that areas with natural dunes and freshwater lenses are being exploited for development. These sites, which are crucial for maintaining the region’s natural water, are now targeted for construction. Along the seashore, private resorts are being planned and, in some places, have already been built. These resorts form continuous fences that block public access to the beach.

- To address the issues, we proposed creating a park on the dune site rather than filling in the freshwater lenses and constructing new buildings. Preserving these water lenses is needed, as blocking them could degrade the lagoon’s water quality and negatively impact the livelihoods of local fishermen.  
- We recommended leaving natural corridors between resorts. This approach serves two purposes: it maintains public access to the beach and creates natural axes that help preserve the existing ecosystem supporting the lagoon.  
- We also suggested leveraging the unique features of the area—such as the mango park, lagoon, and fishermen’s village—to develop tourism in a way that benefits both visitors and residents. By integrating these attractions with the dune park and ensuring beach access, Cam Lam can become an appealing destination while protecting its natural environment and supporting local communities.
