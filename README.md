# The International Summer Camp – Urban Beyond the Urban

UBU is the annual International Summer Camp for “Travelling - Studying - Experiencing” together. 
The UBU 2024 is organized by the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City and 
collaborates with Handong Global University (South Korea), Thammasat University 
(Thailand), Universitas Ngurah Rai (Indonesia), the University of Trieste (Italy), and 
Catholic University of Leuven (Belgium). 

The theme is “Smart Approach: Co-Design Platform & Nature-Based Solutions for Cam Lam, Khanh Hoa”.
We thought about how to develop the area while protecting the nature.
